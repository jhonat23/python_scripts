"""
Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally.The rules of the game are as follows:

Initially there are n towers.
Each tower is of height m.
The players move in alternating turns.
In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where 1<=y<x and y evenly divides x.
If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
Given the values of n and m, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.
